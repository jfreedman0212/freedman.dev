Hey! My name's Josh Freedman. My gateway drug into computing was video games:
I loved playing them and wanted to make them myself. Eventually, this developed into a general
interest in computers, leading to a Computer Science degree and a career as a software engineer.

I live in North Florida with my girlfriend Amaya and our two cats (Little Baby and Nali). Outside
of work and tech, I enjoy rock climbing, running, gaming, volunteering at the local humane society, and 
hanging out with friends and family.

# Work

At work, I mostly do full-stack web development (largely with React in TypeScript and Java). I could say I do it because:

* It's easier for me to help out my team or to fix bugs if I know how everything fits together
* It makes me more valuable since I can see a feature to completion independently
* Some other third professional-sounding thing

And there might be some truth to those, but really it's because I think it's more fun this way.
Honestly, I don't think I _could_ do it if I didn't find it fun.

# This Site

I built this site with:

* [Astro](https://astro.build): to generate the static files for this website
* [Linode](https://www.linode.com/): to host all the programs and files
* [Apache Web Server/httpd](httpd.apache.org/): to route requests to the right site and manage other web config (like TLS)
* [cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/): to generate web pages for my Git repositories (also hosted on my Linode instance)

I did it this way because I wanted to carve out my own little corner of the Internet that I "own". Yes, I rent a VPS so they
technically own the server, but I can take this setup to any other provider if I so choose. It was also fun to set up!
