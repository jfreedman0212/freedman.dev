<h1>Personal Website</h1>

<p>
This is the repository for my personal website. It's built with
<a href="https://astro.build" rel="noreferrer">Astro</a> and hand-rolled
CSS I wrote.
</p>

<h2>Running Locally</h2>

<p>
    You need to have Node and NPM installed locally, ideally Node 19 and NPM 8/9.
    Once you have those installed, run this command from the root directory: <code>npm install</code>.
    This will install all the dependencies needed to run it locally.
</p>
<p>
    Then, to run it locally while you develop, run: <code>npm run dev</code>.
</p>
<p>
    Once you're ready to build, run <code>npm run build</code> and the static HTML and CSS
    will be generated to the <code>dist</code> folder. Package that up and put it in the proper
    folder on your web server to deploy.
</p>

<h2>Content Collections</h2>

<p>
    There are two content collections right now:
    <ul>
        <li>posts: contains blog posts, will automatically be added in and sorted</li>
        <li>pages: contains assorted pages for the website, needs to be added manually when a new one is created</li>
    </ul>
</p>
